### Is this pair.io thing for me?

Do you use vi, emacs, or other terminal-friendly editor?  Are you
comfortable on the command line? Do you write software? Then yes, this
thing is for you.

Long-term, we'll support GUI.

### But wait, I don't pair. Why should I use this?

Because, FFS, you're a professional (or you want to be). I'm not saying you have to use
pair, but you should probably be looking into something that gives you
disposable, repeatable dev environents. Check out
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) for a great local option.
