# Alpha

## Collaboration

**You are able to add collaborators that are not on the alpha list to your instances.**
They'll still be given an account on your instance,
and will be able to set their hooks, re-import keys, etc on the [user
config page](https://pair.io/config).

Pretty much the only thing you can't do is spin up instances.
