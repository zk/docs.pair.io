### Is this pair.io thing for me?

Do you use vi, emacs, or other terminal-friendly editor?  Are you
comfortable on the command line? Then yes, this thing is for you.

### But wait, I don't pair. Why should I use this?

This sounds a lot like "But I only work by myself, why do I need
a DVCS?"

Because, FFS, you're a professional (or you want to be). I'm not saying you have to use
pair, but you should probably be looking into something that gives you
disposable, repeatable dev environents. Check out
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) for a great local option.
