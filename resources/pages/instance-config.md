## Quickstarts

Quickstarts are designed to get you up and working quickly on your
repository.  They are images built with sensible default for their
respective language stacks, and can be used to quickly launch a repo
that for whatever reason dosen't have a `.pair.io/config.yaml`.

See the [quickstarts page](/quickstarts.html) for more information.

You can force a particular quickstart by adding the following to your
`config.yaml`:

    # Force MRI 1.9 quickstart.
    quickstart: ruby19
