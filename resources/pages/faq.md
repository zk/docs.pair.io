# FAQ

### Is this pair.io thing for me?

Do you use vi, emacs, or other terminal-friendly editor?  Are you
comfortable on the command line? Do you write software? Then yes, this
thing is for you.

Down-the-line, we'll support GUI.

### What's pair.io about?

1. Repeatable, disposable dev environments.
2. Real-time, collaborative software development.
3. Making 1 & 2 easy.

### So why is it called pair.io?

Dev.io was taken, I really
like the name pair.io, and it has something to do with what this is
about.

Also

was taken (don't check).  

### Why should I use this?

Because you're a professional (or you want to be). I'm not saying you
have to use pair, but you should probably be looking into something
that gives you disposable, repeatable dev environments. Check out
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) for a great local option.
