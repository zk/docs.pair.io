# General

[pair.io](https://pair.io) gives you a one-button,
collaboration-friendly dev box for your [github](https://github.com)
repo.

## Why pair.io?

Repeatable, disposable dev instances.

  * Repo maintainer specifies box config (overridable).
  * Mistype `rm -rf ./` to your heart's
  content.
  * No 'works on my machine'.
  * No project-specific state on your local box.

Dead-simple collaboration. Here's what they'll need:

  * One (1) github account.
  * One (1) key pair.
  * One (1) terminal.
  * One (1) half-decent pipe.

Nice UX around the whole thing.

## Getting Started

There's an easy way, and an easy-but-slightly-more-time-consuming way to get
started.  We'll cover the easy way here (quickstarts). See the
[instance config page](/instance-config.html) for more info.

This works if you've got a Clojure, Rails 3, Ruby 1.9, or NodeJS
project.
  
1. Log in at [https://pair.io](https://pair.io).
2. Click **New Session**.
3. Type in the repo you want to work on.  For example, if you want to
work on [https://github.com/zkim/cljs](https://github.com/zkim/cljs),
type in `zkim/cljs`.
