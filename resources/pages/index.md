# General

Pair.io gives you a one-button,
collaboration-friendly dev box for your [github](https://github.com)
repo. 

## What's this about?

Repeatable, disposable dev instances.

  * New dev? Get up and running in minutes.
  * Mis-type `rm -rf ./` to your heart's content.
  * No leaking project-specific state.

Real-time collaboration. Here's what they'll need:

  * One (*1*) github account.
  * One (*1*) key pair.
  * One (*1*) terminal.
  * One (*1*) half-decent pipe.

Plus, you get a nice UX around the whole thing. Grab your dotfiles, it's going to be a good time.
